const totalDays = 30; // monthly billing
const unusedAmount = (11.99 / 30) × daysRemaining
const prorationAmount = 89.99 - unusedAmount

// Annual Gaia ($59.90/year) → Outside+ Annual ($89.99/year)
const totalDays = 365; // annual billing
const unusedAmount = (59.90 / 365) × daysRemaining
const prorationAmount = 89.99 - unusedAmount
```
