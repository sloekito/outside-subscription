## 🚀 Running the Application

The dev server is currently running at: **http://127.0.0.1:5174/**

### Commands
- **Start dev server**: `npm run dev`
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Preview build**: `npm run preview`

- Upgrade section (if on Gaia Premium):

  - "Upgrade Now" button
  - Opens modal with proration details

### 4. Upgrade Modal
**Features:**
- Plan comparison (current vs. new)
- Proration calculation:
  - Shows prorated charge
  - Displays credit for unused time
  - Explains next billing amount
- Feature list for new plan
- Confirm or cancel upgrade
- Redirects to payment with proration applied

## 💰 Proration Logic

When a user upgrades from Gaia Premium to Outside+:

```javascript
// Calculate days remaining in billing cycle
const daysRemaining = (nextBillingDate - today) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)

// Calculate unused portion of current plan
const unusedAmount = (currentPlanPrice / 30) × daysRemaining

// Calculate prorated charge for upgrade
const prorationAmount = newPlanPrice - unusedAmount

// User pays prorationAmount today
// Next month, they pay full newPlanPrice
```

**Example:**
- Current plan: Gaia Premium ($59.90)
- Days remaining: 15 days
- Unused amount: ($59.90 / 30) × 15 = $29.95
- New plan: Outside+ ($89.99)
- **Prorated charge today**: $89.99 - $29.95 = $60.04
- **Next month**: $89.99

## 🎨 Design System

### Styling Approach
- **Font**: Plus Jakarta Sans (same as outside-signup)
- **Primary Color**: `rgb(255, 209, 0)` (yellow)
- **Layout**: Clean, modern cards with shadows
- **Animations**: Smooth fade-ins and transitions
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design

### Key Design Elements
1. **Progress indicators** - Visual feedback for user actions
2. **Hover effects** - Subtle elevation on interactive elements
3. **Form validation** - Real-time feedback with error states
4. **Loading states** - Spinners and disabled states during processing
5. **Modal overlays** - Backdrop blur with centered content

## 🔄 State Management

The app uses React state and React Router for navigation:

```javascript
// App.jsx manages global state
- selectedPlan: Currently selected plan
- currentSubscription: Active subscription after purchase
- upgradeInfo: Proration details when upgrading
```

### Flow Control
1. User selects plan → `selectedPlan` set → Navigate to /payment
2. Payment succeeds → `currentSubscription` set → Navigate to /manage
3. User upgrades → `upgradeInfo` set → Navigate to /payment with proration
4. Upgrade payment succeeds → `currentSubscription` updated

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Payment Processing
Currently simulated with timeouts. Ready for Stripe integration:
- Stripe.js and React Stripe Elements included in package.json
- Payment form structured for Stripe Elements
- Card input formatting matches Stripe standards
- Apple Pay and Google Pay handlers ready

### Routing
Using React Router 6 with protected routes:
- `/` - Product selection (always accessible)
- `/payment` - Requires selectedPlan
- `/manage` - Requires currentSubscription

### Data Flow
```
ProductSelection
  ↓ (selects plan)
PaymentForm
  ↓ (processes payment)
SubscriptionManagement
  ↓ (clicks upgrade)
PaymentForm (with proration)
  ↓ (processes upgrade)
SubscriptionManagement (updated)
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

For production deployment:
1. **Never store raw card details** - Use Stripe.js
2. **Validate on backend** - Client validation is UX only
3. **Use HTTPS** - Required for payment processing
4. **Implement CSP** - Content Security Policy headers
5. **Add rate limiting** - Prevent abuse
6. **Use secure cookies** - For session management
7. **Add CSRF protection** - For form submissions

## 📝 Next Steps for Production

### Backend Integration
1. **API Endpoints**:
   - `POST /api/subscriptions` - Create subscription
   - `GET /api/subscriptions/:id` - Get subscription details
   - `PATCH /api/subscriptions/:id/upgrade` - Upgrade plan
   - `DELETE /api/subscriptions/:id` - Cancel subscription
   - `PATCH /api/subscriptions/:id/payment-method` - Update payment

2. **Database Schema**:
   ```sql
   subscriptions:
     - id
     - user_id
     - plan_id
     - status (active, canceled, past_due)
     - current_period_start
     - current_period_end
     - stripe_subscription_id
     - stripe_customer_id
   ```

3. **Stripe Integration**:
   - Create Stripe Customer on signup
   - Create Stripe Subscription with price_id
   - Handle webhooks for payment events
   - Implement proration mode: 'create_prorations'

### Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test complete new subscription flow
- [ ] Test upgrade from Gaia to Outside+
- [ ] Test proration calculations
- [ ] Test all payment methods
- [ ] Test form validation
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test browser compatibility

### Enhancements
- [ ] Add email confirmation after purchase
- [ ] Implement invoice generation
- [ ] Add subscription pause feature
- [ ] Create admin dashboard
- [ ] Add analytics tracking
- [ ] Implement A/B testing
- [ ] Add promotional codes
- [ ] Create annual billing option

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Payment Processing**: Currently simulated, needs real Stripe integration
2. **Authentication**: No user login/signup flow
3. **Email**: No email confirmations
4. **Persistence**: State lost on page refresh (needs backend)
5. **Error Handling**: Basic error states, needs comprehensive error handling
6. **Analytics**: No tracking implemented
7. **Accessibility**: Basic ARIA support, needs full audit
